require_once() function can be used 
to include a PHP file in another one, 
when you may need to include the called file more than once. 
If it is found that the file has already been included, 
calling script is going to ignore further inclusions.

If a.php is a php script calling b.php 
with require_once() function, 
and does not find b.php, 
a.php stops execution causing a fatal error.
